Simple Calculator Using Stack - README

This simple calculator is implemented using a stack data structure to evaluate arithmetic expressions. The calculator supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By utilizing the stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) property, the calculator efficiently processes expressions in postfix (Reverse Polish) notation, ensuring accurate and fast computation.
Features:

    Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
    Handles integer and floating-point numbers.
    Utilizes stack data structure for managing operands and operators, ensuring correct order of operations.

How It Works:

    The user inputs a mathematical expression in postfix notation.
    Each operand is pushed onto the stack.
    When an operator is encountered, the required number of operands are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.
    The final result is the remaining item on the stack after the entire expression is processed.
